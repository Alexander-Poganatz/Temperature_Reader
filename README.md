# Temperature_Reader
A project that gets information from a temperature-humidity sensor onto a web page

# Purpose:
This is a project I was interested in when I started playing with an Arduino and thought it would be nice to
send data to the webpage

# Setup:
The arduino sketch in the Temperature_Humidity folder has to be compiled and pushed to the Arduino.
the DHT11 library files have to be installed

After running npm install for the server-client, 
run: node app.js
